### [owo_upload.py](./owo_upload.py)
Sends media to the OwO service.

Install [requirements](./requirements.txt):

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please run `owo_upload.py --help`. You must specify a token and, optionally, a custom base URL to use this.
For now, you should run this script on your local machine, as it will automatically copy your upload's URL to the system's clipboard.
